## Commit Message Guidelines

Commit messages for this repository should follow the "Conventional Commits" specification.
Each message must start with one of the following keywords:

```
build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test
```

Include a brief description after the keyword, starting with a capital letter and no ending period. For example:

```

```

Please use `feat` for new features, `fix` for bug fixes, or one of the other keywords when appropriate.

To mark breaking changes, include a `!` after the keyword. For example:
